The context explains that the choice of the central frequency for ultrasound imaging is based on the optimization of three parameters: transducer bandwidth, skull-attenuation coefficient, and SonoVue backscattering coefficient. The values detailing the relative intensity, or acoustic power generated by ultrasound (ISPTA), and thermal indices (TI), were also explained. However, specific adjustments required for different applications like cardiac imaging, prenatal imaging, or imaging of soft tissue injuries were not detailed in the provided context.

The context provided indeed explains how the principles of physics, specifically those related to sound waves, frequencies, and echoes, are critical to the operation of an ultrasound machine. According to the context, the central frequency of an ultrasound machine is chosen based on optimization factors that include the available transducer bandwidth, skull-attenuation coefficient, and SonoVue backscattering coefficient. This indicates that the frequency used will influence the attenuation of the soundwave, hence the quality and type of image produced (s41551-021-00697-x, p. 8). Echoes and reverberations also play a pivotal role in ultrasound imaging, as is evident in the context's reference to delay-and-sum beamforming and echo correction processes for clear image creation (s41551-021-00697-x, p. 7)."
