## üìã Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd LLM_GIS
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up API keys** (for LLM providers):
```bash
# Option 1: Environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Option 2: Use .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
```

4. **Add your documents**:
- Place PDF and text files in the `docs/` folder
- The system will automatically process and index them

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the System
```bash
python main.py
```

   - Automatically identifies topics needing review
   - Intensive practice on specific weaknesses

3. **Test Mode**: Assessment with automatic grading
   - Questions generated from your documents
   - Performance tracked in memory system

4. **Insights Mode**: View detailed analytics
   - Learning patterns and optimal study times
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Spaced repetition schedule

5. **LLM Mode**: Manage language model providers
   - Switch between providers
   - Add API keys
   - Test provider connections

6. **Sources Mode**: View document statistics
   - See indexed documents
   - Check RAG system status

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!help` | Show available commands |
| `!explain` | Get more detailed explanation |
| `!example` | See another example |
| `!hint` | Get a hint for current question |
| `!skip` | Skip current topic |
| `!pause` | Pause and save session |
| `!ask [question]` | Ask a specific question |
| `!difficulty [level]` | Adjust difficulty (easy/medium/hard) |
| `!progress` | View current progress |
| `!quit` | End session |

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Domain Expert** (`domain_expert.py`)
   - Handles all content generation (explanations, examples, questions)
   - Integrates with advanced RAG system
   - Supports multiple LLM providers

2. **Planner Agent** (`planner.py`)
   - Creates structured learning plans
   - Manages prerequisites and progression
   - Purely structural, delegates content to domain expert

3. **Interactive Session** (`interactive_session.py`)
   - Manages dynamic user interactions
   - Handles command parsing and execution
   - Maintains session state

4. **Advanced RAG** (`advanced_rag.py`)
   - Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)
   - Document processing and chunking
   - Reranking for better relevance

5. **Enhanced Memory** (`enhanced_memory.py`)
   - Deep learning analytics
   - Pattern recognition
   - Personalized recommendations

6. **LLM Providers** (`llm_providers.py`)
   - Unified interface for multiple LLMs
   - Easy provider switching
   - Fallback handling

## üîß Configuration

### LLM Configuration (`llm_config.json`)
```json
{
  "default_provider": "openai",
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "model": "gpt-4",

Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you want to query OpenAI.
Without it, stub responses will be returned.

The planner is implemented as an agent that queries the domain expert LLM to
create learning plans and drive teaching loops. The domain expert includes a
minimal retrieval step that pulls text snippets from the `docs/` directory and
injects them into prompts (a lightweight RAG approach). If no API key is
provided or parsing fails, defaults from `topics.json` are used.
