The correct answer was: By interpolation from known shifts for a number of control points in the same area.\n\nExplanation: The context mentions that the required shift in a coordinate to transform it from its original TRF to a target TRF is found by interpolation from known shifts for a number of control points in the same area. This process allows for the transformation of a specific geographic coordinate that falls within a grid cell with points of known shifts at each of its four corners.",

The correct answer was: The x-coordinate is positive from the zero meridian to 90\u00b0 W longitude and from the zero meridian to 90\u00b0 E longitude.\n\nExplanation: In the context of GIS, the zero meridian is significant because it is the point from which the x-coordinate is positive to 90\u00b0 W longitude and to 90\u00b0 E longitude. It helps establish the positive and negative values of the x-coordinate.",
